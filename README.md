# Assembly and Annotation of _Aspergillus melleus_ IMV 01140
Tools to support assembly and annotation for _Aspergillus melleus_ IMV 01140

Scripts to support Yuan et al. 'Identification of the neoaspergillic acid biosynthesis gene cluster by establishing an in vitro CRISPR-ribonucleoprotein genetic system in Aspergillus melleus'

Code written by Jason Stajich with Bo Yuan

Depends on funannotate (https://funannotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), AAFTF (https://github.com/stajichlab/AAFTF) as well as a raft of dependencies for assembly software, repeat masking, gene prediction, and sequence similarity searching.
